package OoPs.Constructors;
/*Constructor is a block of code that initializes the newly created object. A constructor resembles an instance method in java but it’s not a method as it doesn’t have a return type. In short constructor and method are different(More on this at the end of this guide). People often refer constructor as special type of method in Java.

        Constructor has same name as the class and looks like this in a java code.

public class MyClass {
    //This is the constructor
    MyClass(){
    }
   //....

}
